# E_Commerce_Store

This project is, as for now, split into 3 packages:

  - hash_table: is the data structure used to store items in the e_commerce_store
  - server: is the e_commerce_store it self. It provides functionalities to access and modify the stock inside the store
  - util: will contain all the utilities that are not directly related to the project (such as exception management)
