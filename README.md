# E_Commerce_Store

This project is, as for now, split into 4 packages:

  - hash_table: is the data structure used to store items in the e_commerce_store
  - server: contains, as for now, both the e_commerce_store it self and a server listening to client requests (in form of text messages)
  - clients: it contains, as for now, a regular client who can send text messages to the server
  - util: contains all the utilities that are not directly related to the project (such as exception management, general server/client utilities...)
